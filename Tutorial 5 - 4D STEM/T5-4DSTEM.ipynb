    "Typical imaging methods in STEM sum up all the electrons falling on the detector area to form the image. Depending on range of scattered angles you collect on the detector, you can get different types of contrast on your image - phase contrast, diffraction contrast, Z contrast, etc. With recent developments in pixelated detectors, it has become possible to efficiently collect the whole diffraction pattern at each scan position. The resulting datasets have 4 dimensions - 2 dimensions in real space along the scan directions, and a 2 dimensional diffraction pattern for each real space pixel, hence the technique is popularly called 4D-STEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, 4D-STEM datasets are huge (a single 128 x 128 scan on EMPAD gives 1 GB data) and hence it is important to be familiar with the different tools to analyse the data. This notebook is aimed at introducing you to the different kinds of imaging modes possible with 4D-STEM data, and what information these different modes provide about the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of another application of 4D-STEM, we also demonstrate strain mapping on PTO/DSO sample, using the Exit Wave Power Cepstral (EWPC) transform method developed at Cornell - [Padgett et al., Ultramicroscopy 214, 112994 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.112994). \n",
