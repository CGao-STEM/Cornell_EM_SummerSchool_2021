    "Electron diffraction patterns provide valuable information about the symmetry and structure of materials. Here we will show you the basic tools for simulating diffraction patterns and atomic-resolution images using the multislice method, through the open-source software [MuSTEM](https://github.com/HamishGBrown/MuSTEM). MuSTEM can be run as a precompiled executable directly in Windows, or through Wine in Mac and (probably) Linux. By the end of this tutorial, we hope you have a better intuition for diffraction simulation, and will be able to use this tool in your own research. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Sections 1-3, you will learn about diffraction simulation through running pre-assembled code. In Section 4, you will get to run a simulation from scratch, defining the input crystal structure yourself. If you don't get to Section 4, don't worry about it! Sections 1-3 will still give you a good introduction. \n",

Both image types are generated through a virtual annular detector, with the difference being the size and location of the inner and outer rings. \n",

The signal is dominated by scattering from the nucleus (Rutherford scattering) and so is very sensitive to atomic number Z: the contrast is roughly proportional to Z<sup>2</sup>. This makes it excellent for imaging heavier elements, but not great for imaging light ones, such as carbon or oxygen. \n",

    "\n",
    "> 1. ***`interpolation`***: The maximum pixel dimension of the image. The final simulation will be interpolated to this image size.\n",
    "> 2. ***`tile_interpolation`***: The number of times the unit cell will be tiled in the final image (if it doesn't form a square cell, then the max. number of probe positions will apply to the longer side.)\n",
    "> 3. ***`detector_radii`***: The radii of the annular detector(s), in milliradians. For example, if your convergence angle is `20` mrad, then a bright-field detector could have inner and outer rings at `0` and `5` mrad, while a HAADF detector could have rings at `80` and `200` mrad. These are the values used below. \n",
    ">4. ***`aperture`***: This isn't a new parameter, but its value will be different than in the CBED simulations. Recall that the aperture size defines the real-space resolution (big aperture = better resolution). For atomic-resolution STEM experiments, we tend to use an aperture size of 20-30 mrad. \n",
    "\n",
    "When simulating annular dark field STEM images, it's important to keep the size of the diffraction grid (***`num_pix`***) large (at least `1024x1024` pixels).

    "* [1.2. Loading and viewing the simulated CBED patterns](#section1.2)\n",
    " * We can view the diffraction patterns in linear or log contrast. The log contrast is better for viewing both the unscattered and high-order scattering CBED disks.\n",

    "* [2.2. Changing the supercell size](#section2.2)\n",
    " * The tiling size sets the number of times the unit cell is repeated in the *x* and *y* directions to make a supercell. A supercell of at least 30x30 Angstroms is needed to prevent artifacts from wrapping errors. \n",
    " * If your supercell is bigger than 30x30 A, then you don't *have* to tile it. Ex: if you have a large nonperiodic structure. \n",
    " * A bigger supercell results in larger and more separated CBED disks. (Kind of like increasing camera length.)\n",
    " * You must set the tile sizes such that the supercell is square, for circular CBED disks. \n",
    "* [2.3. Changing the crystal thickness](#section2.3) \n",
